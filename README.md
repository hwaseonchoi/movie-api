# Get Movie Details
This is a simple Api to consume the [Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to create a single endpoint to get primary information about a movie.

## Requirements
You should have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) installed, which is a 
package manager for PHP because the api is made with [Symfony 5](https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html) & [Api Platform](https://api-platform.com/) to make this work.
